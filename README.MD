# mRNA Analysis of Innate-like T Cells in Mice Treated with LiNKTcellsofαGalCer/CD1d-NP

Introduction: This repository contains the code and instructions I used for performing a full mRNA analysis of iNKT cells in mice treated with LiNKTcellsofαGalCer/CD1d-NP 
and untreated controls. The analysis includes various visualization techniques such as PCA, and volcano plots, among others. The primary focus is on using subread 
for alignment and subsequent analysis of the data and making sure that my codes are correct and make sense.
