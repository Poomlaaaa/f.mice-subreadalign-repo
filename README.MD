# mRNA Analysis of Innate-like T Cells in Mice Treated with LiNKTcellsofαGalCer/CD1d-NP

#Introduction: This repository contains the code and instructions for performing a full mRNA analysis of innate-like T cells in mice treated with LiNKTcellsofαGalCer/CD1d-NP 
#and untreated controls. The analysis includes various visualization techniques such as MA plots, PCA, and volcano plots, among others. The primary focus is on using Subread 
#for alignment and subsequent analysis of the data.
