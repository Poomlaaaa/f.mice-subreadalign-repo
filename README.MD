mRNA Analysis of Innate-like T Cells in Mice Treated with LiNKTcellsofαGalCer/CD1d-NP

Introduction
This repository contains the code and instructions I used for performing a full mRNA analysis of iNKT cells in mice treated with LiNKTcellsofαGalCer/CD1d-NP and untreated controls. The analysis includes various visualization techniques such as PCA, volcano plots, and more. The primary focus is on using subread for alignment and subsequent analysis of the data, ensuring that the code is accurate and logical.

In this analysis, I utilized 10x Genomics data and processed it as bulk RNA to observe overall changes. This approach was taken to gain a broad understanding of gene expression alterations and to validate the consistency of my analysis pipeline when applied to bulk RNA-seq data.

Data Set
My dataset is from PRJNA707550 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE168488).

Objectives
Perform mRNA analysis of iNKT cells in treated and untreated mice.
Utilize various visualization techniques to interpret the data.
Validate the analysis pipeline using bulk RNA-seq data to observe overall changes.
Ensure that the code is accurate and logically sound.
Methods
